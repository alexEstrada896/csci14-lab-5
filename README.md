1. (5 pts) Write a program in C++ that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The formula is

F= 9/5 C + 32
F is the Fahrenheit temperature, and C is the Celsius temperature.

Your program should have a reasonable prompt for the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. Display the converted temperature to the user.


2. (5 pts) Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in a savings account after one year may be calculated as
Amount = Principle(1 + rate/t)^t

Principal is the balance in the savings account, Rate is the interest rate, and T is the number of times the interest is compounded during a year (T is 4 if the interest is compounded quarterly).

Write a program in C++ that asks the user for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times the interest is compounded with reasonable prompts. You don't need to worry about rounding numbers. Your program need to display a report similar to

Interest Rate: 4.25 %
Times Compounded: 12
Principal: $ 1000.00
Interest: $ 43.34
Amount in Savings: $1043.34
